### Description

The only pact file(vem-val.json) is a duplicate of pact file from https://github.com/edx/video-encode-manager/blob/master/encode_manager/apps/core/tests/pact_tests/pacts/vem-val.json. This is temporarily needed until pact broker can be setup. Until then, any update in the original pact should be ported in the json in VAL.
